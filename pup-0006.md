## Summary

For the [Pulp project repositories](https://github.com/pulp/), there is no written process to
describe giving the commit bit to a contributor. The current committers want to openly document
the process.


## Motivation

Comitter - is an individual who has write permissions to a
[Pulp Organization](https://github.com/pulp/) repository.
To have "a commit bit" means one is permitted to commit those changes.

Historically the commit bit was given on day 0 when hired on the core team at Red Hat.  In Oct 2017
the existing committers decided to stop that practice and instead document an open process.
Engineers hired on the Pulp team since Oct '17 have not received commit bit.

We have not yet documented an open process of which to become a committer.
The process outlined in this document is inspired by the processes used in Chromium projects and
Apache Software Foundation.


## Scope

This policy is intended as the default for all software in the
[Pulp Organization](https://github.com/pulp/) unless explicitly stated otherwise.


## Becoming a committer.

Overall the candidate must have demonstrated:
* project commitment, active involvement and care towards the needs of all Pulp users and not only
  their own interests
* contribution of constructive code reviews
* the ability to collaborate with the team and understand its policies and workflows
* understanding of the projects' code base and functionality by submitting code that was accepted
  and merged in the repositories of interest

These requirements are somewhat vague by design and leave the decision to the judgement of the
existing committers. Users rely on the judgement of committers already, so to rely on that judgement
to accept new contributors is reasonable. Anyone who specifically wants to get more involved should
approach the existing commit bit holders about mentorship.


## Process

A nomination or self-nomination email should be sent to the pulp-dev email list and must contain
the following:

* Name and email of the nominee. This can be a self-nomination.
* Explanation of why the nominee should be a committer.
* Repository being requested.
* Vote end date. Must be 7 calendar days from now.

To pass, a +1 vote is required from the majority of existing committers for that repository and
no -1 votes.

If a nomination does not pass, the candidate may be re-nominated after a cool down period of 60
days.


# Revocation of the committer status

If there are problems or disagreements within the community, they can usually be solved through
open discussion and debate.

In the unhappy event that a committer continues to disregard good citizenship (or actively disrupts
the project), that person's status may be revoked. The process is similar as for nominating a new
committer with a +1 voting of two-thirds of the existing committers for that repository.

In case of voluntary resignation of the commit bit, an email should be sent with the notification and
reasoning. No further voting should take place.


## Drawbacks

A single committer can block a new candidate. This could limit contribution unnecessarily and
possibly create fairness issues.

Candidates might get waived through because casting a blocking vote can be uncomfortable.


## Alternatives

One alternative is to use hard metrics such as time involved, feature planned and implemented,
bugs fixed, etc. Overall hard metric system can be gamed which is a major downside. Also a metrics
based process does not help unify the committer base like a unanimous vote would.


## Unresolved Questions

None.
