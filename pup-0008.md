## Summary

PUP-8 proposes the adoption of an official Python code style and set of tools for the Pulp
3 community.

### Background

While most Pulp projects adhere to PEP 8[0], there is still room for different code styles to emerge
and different toolsets to be used to enforce style for Python code. This PUP seeks to come to a
common agreement about which style and tools we use. Specifically, this PUP proposes adoption of
black[1] along with pydocstyle[2] as the official toolset for formatting and linting Python code.

## Motivation

Different coding styles in Pulp 3 are beginning to emerge within the Pulp 3 community that could
make it difficult to switch from one repo or plugin to another. Moreover, style comments create a
lot of noise in PRs and can lead to bikeshedding[3]. In order to free developers from having to
worry about code style, PUP-8 seeks to adopt a single style along with common tooling to aid in
writing Python code.

Another added benefit is that using an autoformatter can make it easier for newer Pulp users
(especially those unfamiliar with Python) to create mergeable PRs. The PR process can be a barrier
to entry for some users and removing style concerns can help to get PRs merged faster.

## Detailed Design

In order to implement this proposal, black and pydocstyle will be used/enforced in the core
repositories (pulpcore, pulpcore-plugin, etc). This will be done via CI. Locally, it will be up to
users to choose how they run these tools.

They will also be added to the plugin_template so plugins can leverage them. If approved, this PUP
can also serve as documentation for what the official style and set of linting tools are for Python
code in the Pulp community.

## Drawbacks

There are a few drawbacks to using black. The main one is that it is an opinionated style and tool.
Not everyone is going to agree with all of its style choices. It is worth noting though that other
popular projects such as django have adopted black[4]. So its style will likely become more
commonplace in the Python community.

Another concern will be that reformatting all of Pulp's python code will likely touch a lot of
places within our codebase and create a lot of noise in git history. However, this would be a
problem with the adoption of any style or autoformatter. Also, adopting black should reduce git
noise in the long run as without it, developers sometimes change style (e.g. indentation) in
commits.

A third concern is that the changes introduced by these tools are irreversible in the sense that we
cannot easily unformat our code to be the way it was before these tools. We can however adopt other
tools and use those to format our code. So while switching from one lint style to another is
possible, it will be hard or impossible to revert our code to the state it was before we start using
black and pydocstyle.

The last drawback is that black is still beta at the time of this PUP. One option would be to wait
for it to go stable first.

## Alternatives

There are other tools for formatting code: autopep8 and yapf. Autopep8 will only format code to meet
pep8 standards. As described earlier, it leaves a lot of room for different code styles to emerge.

The other tool, yapf, is maintained by Google. However, yapf is not PEP-8 compliant. It is also
highly configurable which may or may not be considered as a benefit.

Neither tools are as popular and as the django DEP-8 mentions, "black is maintained in the Python
GitHub organization, it has a good chance of becoming a standard tool of the Python community."

## Rollout

If this PUP is accepted, we will open issues to add black and pydocstyle to each core repository
along with an issue to add documentation for plugin writers on which style and set of tools we
recommend for Python code.
